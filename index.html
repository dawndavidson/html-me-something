  <h1>Getting to know me.</h1>
  <main>

    <p>My name is Dawn Davidson, and I have three children one boy, and two girls. My oldest child will be 21 this year, and my youngest is 12. My son who is my middle child is 14. I decided that it was finally time for me to go back to school, and work towards obtaining my undergrad degree after being out of highschool for 18 years. The company that I work for paid for employees to get these degrees, so I figured why not. In 2019 I graduated from Lindenwood University, here in St.Charles, MO with my Bachelors of Science in Cyber Security. One year later in December of 2020, I was doing it again. This time I got my Master of Science in Human Resource Management. I wasn't quite finished yet, so I applied for a program that would help to launch my career in tech called LaunchCode.</p>

  <h2>My Current Career</h2>
  
  <p>I am currently a Senior Accountant in the Finance department at AT&T. I have been with the company for 21 years, and have had multiple roles. My current plan is to graduate this tech program in January of 2022, and then apply to AT&T's TDP(Technology Development Program) where I will focus on software development.</p>
